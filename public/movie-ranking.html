<h1>The Best Movies According to Rahul</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Piku</h3>
<p>This is one of my favourite movies of all time. I love how they have presented the relationship of a Bengali father-daughter duo. The simplicity of the movie and the journey of the characters are what attract me the most to this film.</p>
<h3>October</h3>
<p>Another simple story which is kind of a love story but different from the traditional Romantic movies. Shoojit Sircar depicts this slow and boring story of two aquaintances in such a beautiful way that this movie stays fresh in your mind for a very long time.</p>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>A Nolan movie which proves to the viewers that love transcends space and time. The most loved movie of all time it captures the story of a father and daughter in a dying world and the love they share even when they get old.</p>
